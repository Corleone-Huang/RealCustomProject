# RealCustom++

Existing Text-to-image customization (or subject-driven generation) methods follow the pseudo-word paradigm, 
which involves representing given subjects as pseudo-words and combining them with given texts to collectively guide the generation.
However, the inherent conflict and entanglement between the pseudo-words and texts result in a dual-optimum paradox, where subject similarity and text controllability cannot be optimal simultaneously.
In this paper, we present \textbf{RealCustom++}, a novel customization paradigm that, for the first time, disentangles subject similarity from text controllability and thereby allows both to be optimized simultaneously without any conflicts.
Rather than the existing conflict-entangled paradigm that represents given subjects as pseudo-words, the core idea of RealCustom++ is to represent given subjects as real words that can be seamlessly integrated with given texts, 
and further leveraging the relevance between real words and image regions to disentangle subjects from texts.
